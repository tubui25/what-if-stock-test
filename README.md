# what-if-stock-test
Background  The What If API is a fun little api that lets a user see how a $100 investment would have performed had a particular US stock was purchased at the beginning of the year.  It will let the user know what day would have been the best day to sell the stock and what day would be the worse day.  Objective   Given a Stock Symbol, the api will return the best day to sell the stock and the worse day to sell the stock.  The API will also return todayâ€™s value (based on close of market yesterday).  Since it is in beta, the what if API will allow the user to retrieve the data from the beginning of the year to do a sanity check.   To help with the test, you can use the following stocks:  AAPL, FB, HD, MSFT    Instructions  Creates a repository in your github account called what-if-stock-test.
